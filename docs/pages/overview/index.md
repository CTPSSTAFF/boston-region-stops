## What is STOPS?

The **Simplified-Trips-on-Project Software (STOPS)** is a stand-alone computer program developed by the FTA that applies a set of travel models to predict detailed transit travel patterns. While it is often used for FTA's Capital Investment Grant (CIG) projects, STOPS is also suitable for a wide range of applications, including transit alternatives analysis, service planning, and long-range transportation planning.

This model uses the **"Synthetic with Special Markets"** approach, which relies on Census data and is supplemented with a special market trip table for air passengers traveling to and from Boston Logan International Airport.
