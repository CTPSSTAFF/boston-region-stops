# Model Outputs

After a model run is complete, STOPS generates a series of text-based report files that summarize the results for the selected forecast year.

## Accessing Reports

You can review the results in two ways:

1.  **Via the STOPS Menu**: Select **Step 12** on the main STOPS menu. This will automatically open the primary results report file.
    

2.  **Directly from the Folder**: Navigate to the **`Reports`** folder in your main model directory (e.g., `C:\BostonSTOPS\Reports`).
