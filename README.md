# Boston Region STOPS User Guide Documentation

Welcome to the repository for the Boston Region STOPS User Guide. This documentation is built using MkDocs with the Material theme.

## Running the Documentation Locally

The documentation can be run locally for development purposes. Instructions on how to do this are included in the project's setup guide.

## Building the Documentation

We have a build process encapsulated in `build.bat` for Windows users, which compiles the static site files and prepares them for deployment.

## Deployment

The documentation is deployed to GitHub Pages following the standard MkDocs deployment procedure.

## Project Structure
